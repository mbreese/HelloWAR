HelloWAR
========

A quick hello-world servlet to test Java application servers.

To build, checkout the repository, and run `ant`. This will build `dist/hello.war`. This file can be added to a Java application server (such as Jetty, Tomcat, etc...). It will respond to requests for `/` with a simple "Hello World" message.
